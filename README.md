# Kylir Horton's Weave Pancake Flipping Assessment

**Hello!** Thank you for taking the time to review my pancake flipping assessment!! It was a lot of fun making this. I enjoyed figuring out the pancake algorithm and how to flip the pancakes in as few moves as possible. I even got my kids involved with it by flipping a stack of plates representing happy/sad pancakes. :)

## How This Works

- Start off by installing dependencies via `npm install`
- Run the Mocha tests using `npm test`
- The app can be run with `node pancakes test.txt`
- You can supply your own input test file or modify `test.txt` too
- This is a Git repo, so you can see the commit history with `git log`

## Thanks!
